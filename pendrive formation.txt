Use the command line to format the usb pendrive

To show the USB drive among all storage partitions and volumes on your computer use:

lsblk
You can also use:

df

Suppose it may be /dev/sdy1. Unmount it with:

sudo umount /dev/sdy1

To format drive with the FAT32 file system format:

sudo mkfs.vfat -F 32 /dev/sdy1

To set a file system label for your pen drive in the process:

sudo mkfs.vfat -F 32 -n 'name_for_your_pendrive' /dev/sdy1

You must include the -F 32 part to specify the FAT size, it is not 32 by default in ubuntu 19.10. For more info see man mkfs.fat.

It will work even if the usb is write protected.

For pen-drive, you don't need the -I option, and might prefer to use: mkfs.fat -v -F 32 -n "MyUsbStick" /dev/sda

To rename a FAT16 or 32 filesystem I am more used to: sudo mlabel -i /dev/sdy1 ::name_for_your_pendrive
